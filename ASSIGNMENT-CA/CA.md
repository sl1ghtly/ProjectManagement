RESOURCE LEVELING

1.	Assign a different resource:
This action does not lead to the extension of the project. However, the cost might increase depending on the assigned resource, therefore the resource would have to be either one that is as equally expensive or one that is cheaper. 
2.	Decreasing the amount of work:
This action leads to the extension of the project. However, the cost shouldnâ€™t increase due to the fact that the specific resource is simply working part time on that specific task for the duration of the project.
